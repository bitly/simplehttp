pubsub_filtered
===============

pubsub_filtered connects to a remote pubsub server and filters out or 
hashes entries before re-publishing as a pubsub stream

will not filter heartbeat messages but will pass them through to all clients

if you have a message like '{desc:"ip added", ip:"127.0.0.1"}' to encrypt the ip you would start pubsub_filtered with '-e ip'
